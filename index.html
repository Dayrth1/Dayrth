    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently learning JavaScript along with the very basics of HTML and
      CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page will link to the various projects I attemp to design and create
      myself. Please feel free to use them if you find them ammusing or usefull.
      It's not likely that they will be either to start with, but as my learning
      progresses you should see the style of this page and the quality of the
      projects improve (hopefully).

      <h2>Grams/Ounces Converter</h2>

        This is a simple form where you enter a value and click a button to
        convert it from grams to ounces or vice versa<br />
        <!-- <a href="Converter/converter.html">Converter</a> -->
